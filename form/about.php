    <p><b>Julian, an avid programmer.</b></p>

    <!-- Programmer Paragraph -->
	<p> 
		I have always been a fan of video games. 
		From Super Mario Bros. to The Last of Us, I have played them all. 
		My love of video games has driven me to begin to program, in the hopes of one day programming video games of my own, 
		and make the game ideas I've had for years a reality. 
		I have attempted to use an Arduino board and learned about the hardware side of technology. 
		I also became the top student of a summer robotics class which required the language, RobotC. 
		I won a HackforPasadena hackathon in 2014 for a website known as E+W Manager, 
		which aimed to help with water and electricity management in the home. 
		I also am currently interning at a new startup called Poppup.
		Throughout my years programming I have learned: HTML5/CSS3, Javascript, jQuery (still learning), PHP (still learning).
