	<!-- Programmmer Heading -->
    <p><b>I am Julian, an avid programmer and video game fanatic.</b></p>

    <!-- Programmer Paragraph -->
	<p> 
		I have always been a fan of video games. 
		From Super Mario Bros. to The Last of Us, I have played them all. 
		My love of video games has driven me to begin to program, in the hopes of one day programming video games of my own. 
		I have attempted to use an Arduino board and become the top of a robotics class. 
		I have even won a hackathon. 
		Throughout my years programming I have learned: HTML5/CSS3, Javascript, jQuery (still learning), PHP (still learning). 
	</p>

	<!-- Music Heading -->
	<p> <b>I am a musician.</b></p>

	<!-- Music Paragraph -->
	<p> 
		In my spare time, when I'm not programming or playing my newest video game, I also like to listen to, play, 
		and compose music. 
		I am a HUGE Coldplay fan and own all 78 of their songs. 
		They have really been a musical inspiration for me. Some of my favorite bands include: 
		The Killers, Muse, and Foster the People, however, I also like Grouplove and the Arctic Monkeys. 
		I am capable when it comes to playing both guitar and piano, the former of which I am more skilled at than the latter, 
		and I am also able to sing along with most of the songs I play. 
		In addition, I also like to write music, and, though I have never fully composed a song, consider myself a talented songwriter.

	<!-- Comic Heading -->
	<p> <b>I am a comic book lover. </b></p>

	<!-- Music Paragraph -->
	<p> 
		I have always been a fan of comic book characters, be it Batman or Superman, Iron Man or the Hulk. 
		Therefore, one of my hobbies includes reading up on comics and learning more about there characters. 
		However, I have never really read comics. 
		Recently though, I have gotten into multiple comic book series, such as the various current X-Men comics, 
		as well as Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers. (While I like DC Comics, I have always been a Marvel fanboy at heart.) 
		Because of this, reading comics is now one of my pasttimes.
	</p>

	<!-- Gamer Heading -->
	<p> <b>I am a gamer.</b></p>

	<!-- Game Paragraph -->
	<p> 
		Above all else, my favorite thing to do when I have downtime is play a video game. 
		I have multiple different game consoles that I play (which include an Xbox 360 and PS4), 
		each with its own set of amazing (and not so amazing) games to go with it. 
		While I have a long list of games that I've played and or own,
		my favorite games include The Binding of Isaac, Fez, Call of Duty (the franchise in general), Halo (again, the franchise), 
		and Injustice: Gods Among Us. There are others I like as well, but those are just some of my core favorites. 
		I am very passionate about gaming, 
		from going on YouTube to figure out a puzzle or researching everything about a game months in advance, 
		which has largely driven my desire to program my own video games, and experience my ideas.
